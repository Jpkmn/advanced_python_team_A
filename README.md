# advanced_python_team_A

For our first assginement, we are trying to build an inventory system for an ecommerce provider.

We need to use the following concepts:
- Classes
  - Inheritance
- Performance improvement
  - Define slotted class (done)
  - List comprehension to create a new list based on the values of an existing list
  - Use "in" for checking membership of a list (done)
  - Do not import modules in the beginning but only when necessary
  - Use sets and unions to check for overlapping values
  - Use test_insert (check this one)
  - Use multiple assignment for variables instead of line-by-line (x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry")
  - Concatenate strings using join() (done)
  - Build infinite loop using while 1
  - In functions, use "raise exception" to leave them early (done)
  - Make use of itertools and more-itertools (https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html, https://more-itertools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
  - Make use of keys to sort items (done)
  - Avoid using global variables (done)
  - Avoid function call overheads
  - Use built-in libraries for data analysis and manipulation (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, ...)
  - Release memory (done)
  - Use garbage collector as a memory management technique

Deliverables:
- Code
- Code must include explanations on what we did and why we used what (esp. for performance improvement code)
