For our first assginement, we are trying to build an inventory system for an ecommerce provider.
We need to use the following concepts:
- Classes
  - Inheritance
- Performance improvement
  - Define slotted class
  - List comprehension to create a new list based on the values of an existing list
  - Use "in" for checking membership of a list
  - Do not import modules in the beginning but only when necessary
  - Use sets and unions to check for overlapping values
  - Use test_insert (check this one)
  - Use multiple assignment for variables
  - Concatenate strings using join()
  - Build infinite loop using while 1
  -
