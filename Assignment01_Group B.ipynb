    "# Assignment 01\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we develop a comprehensive store management system that handles core retail operations, including store, product, order, and customer management. We implement the system using object-oriented programming principles, creating distinct classes for products, customers, orders, and stores. The `Product` class manages product details, stock levels, and sales. The `Customer` class handles customer information and order history. The `Order` class processes customer orders, calculates totals, and tracks order dates. The `Store` class oversees inventory, customer registrations, and order placements. By utilizing these classes and their methods, we ensure streamlined inventory management, customer interactions, and order processing, resulting in a robust and extensible system for retail operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system manages various aspects of store operations, including:\n",
    "- Stores: Information about different store locations.\n",
    "- Products: Details about products, including their categories, prices, and stock levels.\n",
    "- Orders: Management of customer orders, tracking purchases, and updating stock levels.\n",
    "- Customers: Maintaining customer details and their purchase history.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our notebook includes classes and functions to handle these entities, and our goal was to demonstrate object-oriented programming principles and data management techniques to create a comprehensive store management system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as discussed in class, we used efficient programming principles where it made sense."

    "- Inheritance: class Electronics(Product): defines a new class named Electronics that inherits from the Product class. This means that Electronics is a subclass of Product and will have access to its attributes and methods, which makes sense because Electronics are a product category.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Constructor Method: def __init__(self, product_id, name, price, stock, warranty): is the constructor method that initializes the instance variables specific to the Electronics class and calls the constructor of the parent Product class using super().__init__(product_id, name, 'Electronics', price, stock).\n",

These variables are prefixed with a single underscore, indicating they are intended for internal use within the class and its subclasses.\n",
    "- Methods: The Electronics class defines several methods (to_dict, from_dict, get_details, and __repr__). It overrides some methods from the Product class to provide functionality specific to Electronics, such as including the warranty attribute in to_dict and get_details methods. This demonstrates polymorphism, where a subclass can modify or extend the behavior of its superclass.\n",
    "- Dynamic Attribute Assignment: The __slots__ attribute is used to declare specific attributes (warranty) for instances of the Electronics class. This prevents the creation of a __dict__ for each instance, optimizing memory usage and preventing the assignment of attributes not listed in __slots__. This is a more advanced use of attribute management in Python classes.\n",
    "- Static Methods: The method @staticmethod def from_dict(data): is a static method that allows creating an Electronics instance from a dictionary. This method is independent of any particular instance and is called on the class itself. It provides a convenient way to instantiate objects from a data dictionary, demonstrating how static methods can be used for utility functions related to the class.\n",
    "- Special Methods: The method def __repr__(self): is a special method that provides a string representation of an Electronics instance for debugging and logging purposes. This method is overridden from the Product class to include the warranty attribute in the representation, providing a clear and detailed string output when the object is printed or logged."

    "- Save data in feather file: Feather files are used to save data (such as customer data) efficiently. Feather files provide significantly faster read and write times compared to traditional file formats like CSV. This efficiency comes from their binary columnar storage, which optimizes both disk I/O and memory usage, leading to quicker data loading and saving operations, especially for large datasets.\n",

This makes the process of finding overlapping product IDs between the 'Electronics' and 'Kitchen' categories both fast and concise, even for large datasets.\n",

This ensures efficient utilization of memory resources, allowing the system to handle numerous operations and data entries without slowing down due to memory bloat.\n",

This enables the store management system to scale and handle increased loads efficiently.\n",

This reduces the risk of memory-related bugs and leads to cleaner, more maintainable code."
